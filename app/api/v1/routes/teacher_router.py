# ‚úÖ This API should be a websocket
# üîê Verify that the user has the role "teacher"
# üñºÔ∏è Receive the classroom image from the client
# üß† Send the class image to the `face_queue` for processing
#    (Refer to register.py where a job was added to the queue using send_to_queue)
#
# üì§ The WebSocket should gradually return the recognized students in this format:
# {
#     "status": "progress",
#     "recognized": [
#         { "roll": "CS23-001", "name": "Aman" }
#     ]
# }
#
# {
#     "status": "progress",
#     "recognized": [
#         { "roll": "CS23-002", "name": "Sneha" }
#     ]
# }
#
# ‚úÖ When all students are processed, send the final response:
# {
#     "status": "complete",
#     "annotated_image": "<base64-encoded-image>"
# }
#
# üìù Example of how to push a task to the queue (reuse this pattern):
#
#     await send_to_queue("email_queue", {
#         "type": "send_email",
#         "data": {
#             "to": student_data.email,
#             "subject": "Welcome to MarkMe!",
#             "body": f"Hello {student_data.first_name}, your registration is successful!"
#         }
#     }, priority=5)  # Medium priority for email
#
# Replace this with:
#
#     await send_to_queue("face_queue", {
#         "type": "recognize_faces",
#         "data": {
#             "session_id": session_id,
#             "teacher_email": current_user.email,
#             "image_base64": "<classroom-image>"
#         }
#     }, priority=10)

# ‚úÖ Sample success flow:
#     1. Client connects
#     2. Sends base64 image
#     3. Receives gradual progress results
#     4. Receives final annotated image
#
# üì¶ Make sure to integrate annotation logic from the other Git repo into this flow

# Once the face recogniton work is added to the queue , in the file worker_face_recogniton , integrate the logic 
# of the file ( given by me in the other repo )

# In this API, return the full class list for the teacher‚Äôs current session
# Endpoint: GET /student/search

# 1. Ensure that the user is logged in and role = teacher

# 2. From the session context (subject_id), get the subject details
#    ‚Üí Use subject_id (saved in the Attendance)
#    ‚Üí From that subject document, fetch: 
#         - program_id
#         - department_id
#         - semester

# 3. Query the student collection where:
#      - student.program_id == subject.program_id
#      - student.department_id == subject.department_id
#      - student.semester == subject.semester

# 4. Return the list of matching students
#     ‚Üí Each student should include at least: name, roll number, email (optional)

# 5. If no students are found, return an empty array

# @router.get("/student/search")




# In this API, mark the attendance for the session using bitmasking

# 1. Ensure that the logged-in user has the role 'teacher'

# 2. From the session_id, get the timetable info (to fetch list of students)
#    ‚Üí This gives total number of students and their roll numbers

# 3. From the request body, you can expect a JSON like this:
#    [
#      { "name": "Rahul", "rollno": 23 },
#      { "name": "Indar", "rollno": 29 }
#    ]
#    ‚Üí This represents the list of present students

# 4. Generate the attendance bitmask as a string:
#    ‚Üí Length of bitmask = highest roll number (or fixed class size from timetable)
#    ‚Üí Initialize all bits to '0'
#    ‚Üí For each student in the input list, mark '1' at index (rollno - 1)
#       (Note: 0-based indexing ‚Äî so roll no 69 sets bit at index 68)

# 5. Create the final attendance document:
#    {
#      "timetable_id": ...,
#      "subject_id": ...,
#      "teacher_id": ...,
#      "date": today (date only),
#      "day": current day string ("Monday", etc),
#      "slot_index": ...,
#      "attendance_mask": "100101001...01"
#    }

# 6. Save this document to the attendance collection in the DB

# 7. Add an empty placeholder (TODO) for notifying students who were absent
#    ‚Üí After saving attendance, you can later publish a message or trigger notification

# @router.post("/session/markAttendance/{session_id}")
# async def create_Session(
#     credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Depends(security),
#     user_data: dict = Depends(is_logged_in)
# ):

# Injamul Your Work 

# In this route , it is used to add/cancel/reschedule a session for the teacher
# Ask for the timetable_id , date , action (Cancel, Rescheduled, Add)
# The payload data will change based on the action
# If action is Cancel, then slotReference is required
# If action is Rescheduled, then slotReference and newSlot are required
# No fixed structure for the payload, it will change based on the action
# Try to do it in JSON or basic form data using Form 

# Note : Currently work only for the action Cancel and Rescheduled , pass for the action Add
    
# Payload Structure for Action Cancel :-

# {
#   "timetable_id": "68679bca26d91dfb7170c560",
#   "date": "2025-07-25T00:00:00",
#   "action": "Cancel",
#   "slotReference": {
#     "day": "Monday",
#     "slotIndex": 1
#   }
# } 

# Payload Structure for Action Rescheduled :-

# {
#   "timetable_id": "68679bca26d91dfb7170c560",
#   "date": "2025-07-25T00:00:00",
#   "action": "Rescheduled",
#   "slotReference": {
#     "day": "Monday",
#     "slotIndex": 1
#   },
#   "newSlot": {
#     "startTime": "10:00",
#     "endTime": "11:00",
#     "subject": "Maths"
#   }
# }


# Do proper validation for the payload
# If the time_table_id is not present in the database or redis , return proper error
# If the new subject id is having issue , handle that 


# Once data is prepared add to exception_sessions collection in the database
# You can refer to the ExceptionSession Schema class in exception_session.py for the structure
