# Purpose: Fetch basic information of a specific teacher
#
# Flow:
# 1. This route expects a teacher_id in the request body.
# 2. First, verify that the current user has the role 'clerk'. Only clerks are authorized to access this data.
# 3. For Version 1.0:
#    - Attempt to retrieve the teacher's basic info from Redis cache.
#    - The cache key used here is the same one stored during the `/me` route for the teacher, 
#      so thereâ€™s no need to create or duplicate a new cache key specifically for this route.
#    - If the data is present in Redis, return it directly to improve performance.
#    - If not found in cache, fallback logic (optional) can fetch from MongoDB.

# 4. For Version 2.0:
#    - Extend the response with detailed teacher information from MongoDB such as:
#        - Total hours taught
#        - Student performance stats
#        - Attendance records, etc
#
