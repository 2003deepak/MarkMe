# In this route i want to get all teacher listed under the clerk respective department
# First check the role of the user , proceed if clerk is there
# It will be a get request with no body , fetch the department of the clerk and list all the teachers under that department
# Check if the teachers data is present in the Redis DB Cache , if present return it
# If not present , fetch it from the MongoDB and store it in the Redis Cache and
# Make a list of teacher and store it efficiently in redis cache
# Pls exclude the field while fetching data from mongo db ( password, created_at, updated_at) 

# @router.post("/teacher")
# async def get_all_teacher(
#     credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Depends(security),
#     user_data: dict = Depends(is_logged_in)
# ):
    
#     return await get_all_teacher(user_data)



# Purpose: Fetch basic information of a specific teacher
#
# Flow:
# 1. This route expects a teacher_id in the request body.
# 2. First, verify that the current user has the role 'clerk'. Only clerks are authorized to access this data.
# 3. For Version 1.0:
#    - Attempt to retrieve the teacher's basic info from Redis cache.
#    - The cache key used here is the same one stored during the `/me` route for the teacher, 
#      so thereâ€™s no need to create or duplicate a new cache key specifically for this route.
#    - If the data is present in Redis, return it directly to improve performance.
#    - If not found in cache, fallback logic (optional) can fetch from MongoDB.

# 4. For Version 2.0:
#    - Extend the response with detailed teacher information from MongoDB such as:
#        - Total hours taught
#        - Student performance stats
#        - Attendance records, etc
# 

# @router.get("/teacher/:teacherid")
# async def get_teacher(
#     request : 
#     credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Depends(security),
#     user_data: dict = Depends(is_logged_in)
# ):
    
#     return await get_teacher(request , user_data)
