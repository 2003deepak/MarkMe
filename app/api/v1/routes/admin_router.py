# In this route we are deleting the clerk
# First check if role is admin or not
# Check if email id exist with role as clerk 
# If yes then delete the clerk , delete all the keys of redis where clerk data is present ( ex : clerk:yadavsuraj7449@gmail.com , clerk:BTECH)
# Also check if more keys are related to clerk then delete those as well
# Send a response that clerk is deleted successfully , about his account is deleted 
# Just add a message to the email qeueue that clerk account is deleted successfully

# # Ex :- # âœ… Send Delete Email Task to Queue
#         await send_to_queue("email_queue", {

# To check the email queue you can need to run another process
